# sc_environment

This repository provides an updated version of the original workflow YAML file from  
[single-cell-tutorial](https://github.com/theislab/single-cell-tutorial) (see Credits below).  
It has been modified to work with the current environment (e.g., updated package versions, Python 3.10 compatibility).

```bash
conda env create -f sc.yml
